<hr /><br />

Paris Blockchain Week(s) is a community-organized initiative. We have no single
owner. It is an agnostic movement based on the premise that self-organization
is the backbone of the ecosystem. We invite projects, individuals and anyone
interested in fruitful and educational discussions to join us.

Paris Blockchain Week(s) is committed to reduce the noise from the market and
focus on education, in order to push mass adoption via providing first hand
information about the industry.

Our concept is simple: keep it educational, try to be as cost friendly for the
community as you can (bearing in mind, we all need to pay bills - so not all
events are free!) and to create a welcoming environment, so interested parties
at any knowledge level feel comfortable to join.
