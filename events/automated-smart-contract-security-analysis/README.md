# Add or remove paragraphs as needed, but remember the hyphen before each entry.
synopsis:
  -
    This workshop covers how to use automated smart contract analysis
      tooling from a practitioner's perspective. After taking this workshop,
      participants will be able to both use off-the-shelf tooling and write
      their own analyses to find large classes of real-world bugs.
  -
    "We'll begin with an overview of different types of tooling and their
      strengths and weaknesses. After that, we'll take two deep dives: First,
      we'll design property-based tests that let us quickly fuzz a contract
      and even generate minimal exploits for a given bug. Then, we'll use a
      symbolic executor to either find extreme edge case bugs or formally
      verify no such bugs exist."
  -
    Participants should be experienced in Solidity, and ideally Python, but
      no deep security experience is needed. This is a great workshop for
      smart contract developers who want to start making their development
      lifecycle more secure, or anyone interested in security automation in
      the blockchain space.
