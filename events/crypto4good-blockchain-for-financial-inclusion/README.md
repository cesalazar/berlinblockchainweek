synopsis:
  -
    GIZ Blockchain Lab, Tempo, DSTOQ and and Jolocom are partnering for the 3rd
      Crypto4Good panel discussion, featuring experts from both the tech world
      and the international development sector. This event will aim to define
      practical answers to a global issue, financial exclusion, and uncover
      how DLT (distributed ledger technology) could bring positive change.
      
  -
    Around two billion people worldwide do not have access to the financial
      services that meet their needs. Whether as individuals or small and
      medium enterprises (SMEs), many struggle to obtain sufficient financing
      to lift them off poverty, establish a sustained source of income or gain
      the opportunity to obtain shares and invest in assets. DLT could
      alleviate some of these challenges thanks to its decentralized and
      tamper-proof infrastructure, with intermediary-free remittances,
      credit-history for micro-loans or innovative and accessible
      tokenized-assets investments.
      
  -
    Though the features of blockchain-based solutions might sound very
      promising, there are several issues to be tackled. When it comes to
      financial inclusion, major challenges include poor financial and digital
      literacy as well as the lack of identification documents. However, DLT
      can also be leveraged to restructure control over personal data, such as
      identification, and empower users to participate in financial markets.
      
  -
    This event will be an occasion to discuss both the opportunities the
      technology offers and its possible challenges, while assessing the
      conditions in which these solutions could be implemented and what might
      hinder their widespread adoption.
