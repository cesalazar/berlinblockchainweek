    Open source coin is a decentralized network and currency for OSS
      collaboration and incentivisation, that is community owned. It's a
      protocol not an app. It operates one layer underneath an app like
      Github. As a protocol, it extends Git with economic primitives. As a
      network, it aims to be both architecturally and economically
      decentralized.

      Users, individually or collectively, should be empowered to shape the
        technology they use. Software developers are particularly skilled to
        do that, and yet the most popular code hosting platforms give them
        little to no ability to enact changes.
    -
      In this talk, we present radicle, the language used by the open source
        coin platform to give developers full control over their code hosting,
        collaboration, and project governance. Radicle has some unique
        characteristics - most notably self-amendment, or
        evaluation-redefinition - that are interesting in their own right. But
        more importantly, it makes it easy for individuals or groups to
        collectively determine how they interact with one another, and with
        their code.
    -
      After an overview of radicle, we will look at examples, such as custom
        formats and behaviors for issues, access rights, and voting. We will
        also see how radicle can be used not just as a way of defining the
        semantics of chains, but as as way of interacting with them (via
        scripting or a REPL).
